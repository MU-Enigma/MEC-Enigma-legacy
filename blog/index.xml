      <description>.image-center{ display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }  Bots. Who knows what they are? At least I didn’t until sometime ago. All that came to my mind when I heard the word robot was a mechanical machine that kind of resembles humans, might work on AI, blah blah blah. Let’s leave all that science fiction influenced thoughts behind to find out how I built my first bot.
Before I begin, you should probably know that I am a very big fan of custom ROMs.</description>

      <description>.image-center{ display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }  The idea actually reached it&amp;rsquo;s inception during my time working on the Covindia website, when I was discussing stuff with Srikar. The first thing you notice when you text him is his &amp;ldquo;substantial&amp;rdquo; use of the phrase &amp;ldquo;xD&amp;rdquo;. So yes, you can pretty much figure out the next course of action: make a bot that reacts to every xD it encounters until it annoys the sugar honey iced tea out of them.</description>
